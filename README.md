# 🔘 Button Component – React Component Library

This is a **custom `Button` component** developed as part of my internship contribution to a larger React Component Library. The component is designed to be **fully customizable via `className`**, similar to Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap styling conventions.

> 🛠️ This repository only contains the `Button` component I personally built. Other components in the library were developed by other team members and are not included here.
